Step 1: Select the material on which you want to perform the experiment.<br>
Step 2: Select the "Input ball" button To bring the ball near the pin.<br>
Step 3: Insert the ball inside the pin Using the button.<br>
Step 4: Now put the pin on the tribometer Using the button.<br>
Step 5: Select the "Input load (10N)" button put the load on the pin.<br>
Step 6: Now start the rotation of disk to perform the experiment.<br>
Step 7: Use the result button to get the final output with the help of Optical profilometer for wear volume estimation.<br>
Step 8: using the result of optical profilometer we can calculate the wear rate by the following equation.<br>
Specific wear rate can then be calculated using Archard equation as:<br>
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒=(𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒)/(𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑×𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒)
